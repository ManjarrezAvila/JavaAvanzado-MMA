# JAVA Academy: Java Avanzado SE (Standar Edition)

## Introduction

In this course object-oriented programming topics were applied to classes and interfaces. Functional interface and abstract class was defined and used. We also learned how to implement lambdas and its function and program applications through the new interface access modifiers as default or private, acording to a modular programing.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
2. Go download two versions of [IDK](https://adoptopenjdk.net/?variant=openjdk11&jvmVariant=hotspot). Version 9
3. Go download [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/es-es/idea/download/#section=windows) 
4. Follow the instruction for each challenge

## Dependencies

1. Terminal of your choice
2. [IDK](https://adoptopenjdk.net/?variant=openjdk11&jvmVariant=hotspot) version 11
3. [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/es-es/idea/download/#section=windows)

## Instructions

**Exercise 1**

This exercise was about a program that draws figures automatically. It has an abstract class called Figure, and a method called draw(). The problem was, what would you have to do so that the Triangle class can override this method and put the code that makes it draw the indicated shape?

1. In your terminal go to the JavaAvanzado-MMA directory with the command `cd JavaAvanzado-MMA/`
2. Open the file *Figure.java* with the command `code Figure.java`
3. You also can open the file *Figure.java* from this repository

**Exercise 2**

This exercise ask you use the tags for the documentation of the Report library

1. You can open the file *Report.java* inside this directory *JavaAvanzado-MMA\AmazonViewer\src\amazonviewer\makereport\Report.java*

**Exercise 3**

In this exercise we demonstrate how to implement nesting classes in a Java program about the relation ship between Album - Song  where Song will be a class that is only used in Album since the definition of this is a collection of Songâ€™s

1. In your terminal go to the JavaAvanzado-MMA directory with the command `cd JavaAvanzado-MMA/`
2. Open the file *Album.java* with the command `code Album.java`
3. You also can open the file *Album.java* from this repository
