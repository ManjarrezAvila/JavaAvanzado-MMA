# JAVA Academy: Java Avanzado SE (Standar Edition)

## Introduction

In this course object-oriented programming topics were applied to classes and interfaces. Functional interface and abstract class was defined and used. We also learned how to implement lambdas and its function and program applications through the new interface access modifiers as default or private, acording to a modular programing.

## Instructions

**Exercise 1**

This exercise was about a program that draws figures automatically. It has an abstract class called Figure, and a method called draw(). The problem was, what would you have to do so that the Triangle class can override this method and put the code that makes it draw the indicated shape?
